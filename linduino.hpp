   LINduino - (C) 2023 NaokiS
   ==========================
   LIN bus driver for Arduino supporting host and node modes, break detection and error checking

    LIN bus supports up to 16 nodes officially, citing physical wire limits.

    This library is intended for getting started with LIN bus on arduino platforms,
    it does not support extended frames natively.

    LIN node devices can ignore a message, subscribe to a message or publish a response. 
    In simpler non-LIN terms, this means it either is commanded by a message or replies with data.

    The "message" is the ID number. If the ID is one that the node subscribes to,
    then it will listen to the following data bits. If it is one that is publishes to,
    then it will reply with up to 5 data bytes + a CRC sum byte.

    The format for data byte field length is... confusing. So many people say different things.

    The LIN 1.3 specification uses a data length code... *sometimes*.
      "If required (e.g. compatibility to LIN Specification 1.1) the IDENTIFIER bits ID4 and ID5
      may define the number of data fields NDATA in a message. This divides the set of
      64 identifiers in four subsets of sixteen identifiers, with 2, 4, and 8 data fields, respectively."

    This means LIN 1.3, if using DLC, would have up to 64 message types.
      60 "Signal carrying" frames:
      0-31: 2 bytes
      32-47: 4 bytes
      48-60: 8 bytes
      2 for diagnostics over LIN
      1 for user defined extentions
      and 1 that is reserved.

    But LIN 2.0 does not specify any DLC encoding and it just says that the data field may be 0 - 8 data bytes.

    My advice... Just plan how many data bytes each ID needs.

    LIN 1.3: The identifiers 0x3C, 0x3D, 0x3E, and 0x3F with their respective IDENTIFIER FIELDS 0x3C, 0x7D, 0xFE,
      and 0xBF (all 8-byte messages) are reserved for command frames (e.g. sleep mode) and extended frames.
      ... or otherwise known as IDs 60-64.
